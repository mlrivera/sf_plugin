Random Quote Widget & Shortcode
===

By installing this plugin, you will enable Quotes, a custom post type.

To create a quote add a new quote in the Quote's panel that will appear in your dashboard's menu.

A random quote will be displayed through a widget in a theme's widget area and/or anywhere else on the site via its shortcode [rquote].

You can add a personal message through the widgets dashboard which will appear below your quote.

To use in posts, just type in [rquote] in the post editor and a random quote will be generated.
